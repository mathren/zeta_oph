\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


The nearest O-type star to Earth is $\zeta$ Ophiuchi \citep[spectral
type O9.5{\rm IVnn},][]{sota:14}, at % with a parallax of
% 5-8\,milliarcsec corresponding to
a distance of $\sim$110\,pc \citep[e.g.,][and references
therein]{neuhauser:20}. It was originally identified as a runaway star
through its large proper motion by \cite{blaauw:52}, who identified
the Scorpio-Centaurus group as its parent association.  Unfortunately,
the \emph{Gaia} data for this object are not of sufficient quality to
improve previous astrometric results, but estimates of the peculiar
velocity range in $30-50\,\mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$
\citep[e.g.,][]{zehe:18, neuhauser:20}. The
large velocity with respect the surrounding interstellar material is
also confirmed by the presence of a prominent bow-shock
\citep[e.g.,][]{bodensteiner:18}.

Because of its young apparent age, extremely fast rotation
($v\sin(i)\sim 400\,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, e.g., \citealt{zehe:18}),
and nitrogen (N) and helium (He) rich surface \citep[e.g.,][]{blaauw:93,
  villamariz:05, marcolino:09}, $\zeta$ Oph is considered a prime
candidate for the binary supernova scenario \citep{blaauw:61,
  renzo:19walk}. In this scenario, after a phase of mass transfer in a
massive binary, the core collapse of the donor star disrupts the
binary, and the former accretor is ejected with its pre-explosion
orbital velocity. Many studies have suggested $\zeta$ Oph
might have accreted mass from a companion before acquiring its large
velocity, both from spectroscopic and kinematic considerations
\citep[e.g.,][]{blaauw:93, hoogerwerf:00, hoogerwerf:01, tetzlaff:10, neuhauser:20}
and using stellar modeling arguments
\citep[e.g.,][]{vanrensbergen:96}.  More specifically,
\cite{neuhauser:20} suggested that the supernova that ejected $\zeta$
Oph produced PSR B1706-16 and also injected the short-lived
radioactive isotope $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ on Earth about $\sim 1.5$\,Myr
ago. This argues strongly for a successful supernova explosion
accompanied by a large $\sim 250\,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ natal kick,
which would suffice to disrupt the binary.

Although the nature of $\zeta$ Oph as a binary product is well
established, its large rotation rate has lead most attempts to
explain the surface composition to rely on rotational mixing \cite[e.g.,][]{maeder:00}. Even the
binary models of \cite{vanrensbergen:96} assumed spin-up due to
mass accretion \citep[e.g.,][]{packet:81} to drive rotational mixing from the interior of
the accreting star (see also \citealt{cantiello:07}). However,
\cite{villamariz:05} were unable to find good fit for the stellar
spectra using the rotating models from \cite{meynet:00}.

This may not be surprising, since rotational mixing has
lower efficiency for metal-rich and relatively low mass stars because
of the increased importance of mean molecular weight gradients and
longer thermal timescales compared to more massive stars
\citep[e.g.,][]{yoon:06, perna:14}. The parent association of $\zeta$
Oph has $Z=0.01-0.02\simeq Z_\odot$ \citep[e.g.,][]{murphy:21}, and
mass estimates for the star range from $13-25\,M_\odot$, i.e. on the
lower end of the range where efficient mixing might bring He and
CNO-processed material to the surface (chemically homogeneous
evolution).

On top of the surface abundances, its extreme rotation rate,
and the peculiar space velocity, $\zeta$ Oph poses a number of still
open puzzles. Its wind mass loss rate appears lower than commonly
assumed (weak wind problem, \citealt{marcolino:09}), it exhibits
spectral variability with occasional appearance of H$\alpha$ in
emission \citep[e.g.,][]{walker:79}.

  % \item runaway nature
  % \item association with pulsar and SNe polluting Earth
  % \item debate on parent association
  \item weak wind problem

  Methods:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item self-consistent modeling of the evolution \citep[see also][]{vanrensbergen:96}
  \item depends on many free parameters governing the intricate and
    coupled physics of mass transfer, mixing, rotation

  Aim:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item since observations are not always agreeing with each other, we
    aim at finding a model in the right ballpark and explore how
    physical variations move such model around
  \item in this way we find a set of recommended parameters for the
    evolution of massive binary system going through stable mass transfer

the age of the parent association and the surface composition, but
invoked large scale (rotational) mixing during binary evolution for the surface abundances}

We use \code{MESA} version 15140 to compute our models.  The
\code{MESA} equation of state (EOS) is a blend of the OPAL \citet{Rogers2002}, SCVH
\citet{Saumon1995}, PTEH \citet{Pols1995}, HELM \citet{Timmes2000},
and PC \citet{Potekhin2010} EOSes. \todo{update EOS}

Radiative opacities are primarily from OPAL \citep{Iglesias1993,
  Iglesias1996}, with low-temperature data from \citet{Ferguson2005}
and the high-temperature, Compton-scattering dominated regime by
\citet{Buchler1976}. Electron conduction opacities are from
\citet{Cassisi2007}.

Nuclear reaction rates are a combination of rates from NACRE
\citep{Angulo1999}, JINA REACLIB \citep{Cyburt2010}, plus additional
tabulated weak reaction rates \citet{Fuller1985, Oda1994,
  Langanke2000}. Screening is included via the prescription of
\citet{Chugunov2007}.  Thermal neutrino loss rates are from
\citet{Itoh1996}. We compute the pre-merger evolution using an
8-isotope $\alpha$-chain nuclear reaction network and switch to a
22-isotope nuclear network for the post-merger evolution.

We evolve our models from the pre-main sequence to the terminal age
main sequence of the most massive $58\,M_\odot$ star, defined as the
time when the central hydrogen abundance $X(^1\mathrm{H})\leq 10^{-4}$.
We treat convection using the Ledoux criterion, and include
thermohaline mixing (until the central temperature
$\log_{10}(T_c/\mathrm{[K]})>9.45$, \citealt{farmer:16}) and semiconvection, both with an
efficiency factor of 1. We assume $\alpha_\mathrm{MLT}=2.0$ and use
\cite{brott:11} overshooting for the convective core burning. We have
tested that varying core overshooting does not impact significantly the
post-merger evolution, however, when including shell overshooting
and/or undershooting we were unable to find solutions to the stellar
structure equations. Moreover, we employ the MLT++ artificial
enhancement of the convective flux \citep[e.g.,][]{paxton:15,
  jiang:15}. Stellar winds are included using the algorithms from
\cite{vink:01} with an efficiency factor of 1.%  and \cite{nugis:00} when the surface en abundance
% is below 0.4 and $T_\mathrm{eff}>10^{4.7}\,\mathrm{K}$. We use a
% hyperbolic tangent interpolation between the two for
% hydrogen-deficient surfaces with
% $10^{4.5}\,\mathrm{K}\leq T_\mathrm{eff}\leq10^{4.7}\,\mathrm{K}$. In
% both cases, we use an efficiency factor of 1, and our post-merger models never
% become cool enough to use a cool wind algorithm \citep[e.g.,][]{renzo:17}.
