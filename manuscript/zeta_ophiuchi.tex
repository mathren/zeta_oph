\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The overwhelming majority of massive stars is born in multiple systems
\citep[e.g.,][]{mason:09, almeida:17}, and a large
fraction will exchange mass or merge with a companion in their lifetime \citep[e.g.,][]{sana:12}. The most common type of interaction is a post-main-sequence
stable mass transfer (case B) through Roche Lobe overflow
(RLOF, \citealt{kippenhahn:67}, \todo{pop synth. ref.?}.
Many studies \citep[e.g.][]{gotberg:17, gotberg:18,
  laplace:20, laplace:21} have focused on the dramatic
impact of these interactions on the donor star, often treating the
closest binary companion as a point mass. \todo{more refs, other groups}

However, binary interactions have a crucial impact on the secondary
star too. Because of mass transfer, these are expected to accrete mass
and rejuvenate because of the accompanying growth of the convective
core \citep[e.g.,][]{neo:77, schneider:16}, spin up to critical
rotation \citep[e.g.,][]{packet:81, cantiello:07}, and
possibly be polluted by CNO-processed material from the inner core of
the donor star \citep[e.g.,][]{blaauw:93}.

Understanding the evolution of accretors in massive binaries has wider
and crucial implications for stellar populations, electromagnetic
transient observations, and gravitational-wave
progenitors. Specifically, since the majority of massive binaries will
be disrupted by the first supernova \citep[``binary SN scenario'',
][]{blaauw:61, dedonder:97, eldridge:11, renzo:19walk, evans:20},
observed samples of massive stars might contain presently single
O-type stars that accreted mass earlier on. The majority of these will be
too slow to stand out in astrometric surveys
\citep[e.g.,][]{eldridge:11, renzo:19walk}. Assuming a constant star
formation history, \cite{renzo:19walk} estimated that
$10.1^{+4.6}_{-8.6}\%$ of O-type stars might be accretors released
after a SN -- where the errors span a range of
parameter variations. \cite{zapartas:19} showed that $14_{-11}^{+4}\%$
of hydrogen-rich (type II) SNe might come from accretors in
binaries. Their past in a binary can influence their helium (He) core
mass and thus the explosion properties and the inferred progenitors
\citep{zapartas:21}. Finally, the majority of isolated binary
evolutionary scenarios for gravitational-wave progenitors go through a
common-envelope phase initiated by the originally less massive
accretor after the formation of the first compact object
\citep[e.g.,][]{belczynski:16nat, tauris:17,
  broekgaarden:21}. Therefore, it is possible that accretion of mass
before the formation of the first compact object could modify the
internal structure of the star that will initiate the common-envelope
phase \citep[e.g.][]{law-smith:20, klencki:21}.

Despite their importance, accretor stars in binaries have so far
received much less attention than the donor stars, with the pioneering
work of \cite{hellings:83, hellings:84} and \cite{braun:95} as notable
exceptions. Large grids of accretor models are missing, and only
sparse models exist \citep[e.g.,][]{cantiello:07}\todo{more
  refs.}. This is because of the complexity of these models, where one
needs to follow in detail the \emph{coupled} evolution of two rotating
stars exchanging mass. Moreover, the admittedly large number of free
parameters involved in the modeling of each individual star and their
interactions makes robust predictions challenging to obtain. Here, we
will argue that the nearest O-type star to Earth, $\zeta$
Ophiuchi\footnote{also known as HD\,149\,757.} (\zoph) provides a unique
opportunity to constrain these models, and present the first fully
coupled binary evolution calculations with donor masses in excess of
$20\,M_\odot$ tailored to explain the properties of this star.

\zoph\ has a distance from Earth of $107\pm4$\,pc \citep[e.g.,][and
references therein]{neuhauser:20}, and a spectral type O9.5{\rm IVnn}
\citep{sota:14}. It occasionally shows emission lines
\citep{walker:79, vink:09}, making it an Oe star. It was originally
identified as a runaway because of its large proper motion by
\cite{blaauw:52}. Unfortunately, the \emph{Gaia} data for this object
are not of sufficient quality\footnote{The renormalized unit weighted
  error (RUWE) of this star in Gaia EDR3 is 4.48.} to improve previous astrometric results,
but estimates of the peculiar velocity range in $30-50\,\kms$
\citep[e.g.,][]{zehe:18, neuhauser:20}. The large velocity with
respect the surrounding interstellar material is also confirmed by the
presence of a prominent bow-shock \citep[e.g.,][]{bodensteiner:18}.

Because of its young apparent age, extremely fast rotation
($v\sin(i)\gtrsim 400\,\kms$, e.g., \citealt{zehe:18}), and nitrogen
(N) and He rich surface \citep[e.g.,][]{herrero:92, blaauw:93,
  villamariz:05, marcolino:09}, \zoph\ is a prime candidate for the
binary SN scenario \citep{blaauw:93}. Many studies have
suggested \zoph\ might have accreted mass from a companion before
acquiring its large velocity, both from spectroscopic and kinematic
considerations \citep[e.g.,][]{blaauw:93, hoogerwerf:00,
  hoogerwerf:01, tetzlaff:10, neuhauser:20} and using stellar modeling
arguments \citep[e.g.,][]{vanrensbergen:96}. Recently,
\cite{neuhauser:20} suggested that a supernova in
Upper-Centaurus-Lupus produced the pulsar PSR B1706-16, ejected \zoph,
and also injected the short-lived radioactive isotope
$^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ on Earth $1.78\pm0.21$\,Myr ago. This argues
strongly for a successful supernova explosion accompanied by a large
$\sim 250\,\kms$ natal kick, which in most cases would be sufficient
to disrupt the binary.

Although the nature of \zoph\ as a binary product is well
established, its large rotation rate has lead most attempts to explain
the surface composition to rely on rotational mixing
\cite[e.g.,][]{maeder:00}. Even the binary models of
\cite{vanrensbergen:96} assumed spin-up due to mass accretion to drive rotational mixing from the
interior of the accreting star (see also
\citealt{cantiello:07}). However, \cite{villamariz:05} were unable to
find good fit for the stellar spectra using the rotating models from
\cite{meynet:00}.

This may not be surprising: rotational mixing has lower efficiency for
metal-rich and relatively low mass stars because of the increased
importance of mean molecular weight gradients and longer thermal
timescales compared to more massive stars \citep[e.g.,][]{yoon:06,
  perna:14}. The parent association has a metallicity $Z=0.01\simeq Z_\odot$
\citep[based on asteroseismology from][]{murphy:21}, and mass estimates for \zoph\ range from
$13-25\,M_\odot$, at the lower end of the range where efficient mixing
might bring He and CNO-processed material to the surface (chemically
homogeneous evolution).

\todo{maybe paragraph below goes in discussion}
On top of the surface abundances, its extreme rotation rate, and the
peculiar space velocity, \zoph\ poses a number of other
puzzles: its wind mass-loss rate is about two orders of magnitude
lower than theoretical predictions (weak wind problem,
\citealt{marcolino:09}), the star exhibits spectral variability with
occasional appearance of H$\alpha$ in emission
\citep[e.g.,][]{walker:79}, and is potentially magnetic \todo{true?ref?}.

Given the challenges in explaining the surface composition of \zoph\
with rotational mixing from the stellar interior and the strong
evidence for its past as a member of a binary system, this star offers
a unique opportunity to constrain the evolution of accreting stars in
massive binary systems.

Here, we present the first self-consistent binary evolution model for
$\zeta$ Oph computing simultaneously the coupled evolution of
\emph{both} donor and accretor star. After presenting our calculations
in \Secref{sec:methods}, we show our best model which reproduces the
majority of the salient features of this star in
\Secref{sec:best_model}. In this model, the surface abundances of
\zoph\ are explained by pollution from the former companion, rather
than upward mixing from the interior of \zoph\ itself. We discuss the
sensitivity of our results to the admittedly many free parameters
required for this kind of computations in
\Secref{sec:param_variations}. Finally, we conclude in
\Secref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{ \texttt{MESA} modeling of massive binaries}
\label{sec:methods}
\todo{missing Z}
Modeling the evolution of massive binaries
($M_1\gtrsim 20\,M_\odot \geq M_2$) is challenging because of the
intricate role of several notoriously difficult stellar
physics ingredients (differential rotation, mixing, high mass-loss
rates, accretion, etc.) Here we follow self-consistently in one
dimension the coupled evolution of two massive stars in a binary
system using \texttt{MESA} (version 15140). Our choice of input
parameters and our numerical results are available at \todo{link}. We
discuss here only the main relevant physical parameters, and
Appendix~\ref{sec:software} gives more details on our choice of input
physics.

We adopt the Ledoux criterion to determine convective stability and a
mixing length parameter of $1.5$. We include semiconvection and
thermohaline mixing following \cite{langer:83} and
\cite{kippenhahn:80}, respectively, with an efficiency of $1.0$ for
both. We use the exponential core overshooting from \cite{herwig:00}
with free parameters $(f, f_0)=(4.25\times10^{-2}, 10^{-3})$
\cite{claret:17} which broadly reproduce the width of the main
sequence from \cite{brott:11}. We also use the experimental
superadiabaticity reduction \texttt{MLT--} introduced in \texttt{MESA}
15140.

We treat rotation in the ``shellular'' approximation and initialize it
assuming tidal synchronization at the
beginning of the evolution. For our fiducial period choice (see
below), this effectively means both the stars in our binary are
initially slow rotators. Our models include in a diffusive
approximation the effect of Eddington-Sweet circulations
\citep{sweet:50}, which dominates the chemical mixing due to
rotation. We also include the secular and dynamical shear
instabilities, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability as in
\cite{gotberg:17, gotberg:18, laplace:20, laplace:21}.  We assume a Spruit-Tayler
dynamo for the transport of angular momentum \citep{spruit:02}, and chose the same free
parameters as \cite{heger:00} \todo{check this statement}. This also includes the rotational
enhancement of wind mass loss as in \cite{langer:98}.

We treat wind mass loss with the \cite{vink:00,vink:01} hot wind,
and \cite{dejager:88} with a scaling factor of 1. This effectively
means our wind mass loss rate post-mass transfer is overestimated by
almost a factor of 100 \citep[weak wind problem, see][]{marcolino:09}.


Both stars are evolved simultaneously on the same timesteps until
after the donor detaches from the Roche lobe. We follow \cite{kolb:90}
to calculate the mass transfer rate from optically thick layers of the
donor star during Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), and assume that the transfered layers reach
the accretor with the accretor's specific surface angular
momentum. Mass transfer is conservative until the accretor reaches
critical rotation, after which rotationally enhanced mass loss governs
the accretion efficiency.

To define RLOF detachment, we take advantage of the fact that we focus
here on case B interactions among massive stars. After losing its
envelope, massive donors are not expected to expand to hundreds of
$R_\odot$ during He shell burning at the metallicity we consider
\citep[e.g.,][]{laplace:20}. Thus, we define RLOF detachment as the moment
after the onset of RLOF when the donor has a surface He mass fraction
larger than 0.35 (indicating that a significant amount of envelope has
been lost or transferred), a radius smaller than its terminal-age main
sequence (TAMS) radius, and no mass is being transferred anymore. At
this point in time, we save a model for the accreting star, and
continue its evolution as a single star until TAMS with the same
setup.

  Ophiuchi's properties}
\label{sec:best_model}

\todo{maybe mass vs. time and orbital velocity of accretor first?}

\begin{figure}[bp]
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{HRD_both}
  \caption{HRD for the donor star (top) and accretor star (bottom) of
    the progenitor binary of \zoph. Each point corresponds to a MESA
    model, not spread evenly in time. The tracks are colored with the
    stellar age, the red datapoint shows the position of \zoph\
    according to \cite{villamariz:05}, and the black diamonds mark the
    position at the end of the binary run. We continue the accretor
    evolution as a single star from there until core H depletion,
    hence the bottom panel shows a longer time. Note the different
    scales on the two panels. The thin gray dashed line show the main
    sequence evolution of non-rotating single stars of 15, 17, 25, and
    30\,$M_\odot$ at $Z=0.01$ for comparison.}
  \label{fig:HRD_both}
\end{figure}


We describe here the evolution of a binary system with initial masses
$M_1=25\,M_\odot$, $M_2=17\,M_\odot$ on a period of $100$\,days at
$Z=0.01$. \Figref{fig:HRD_both} shows the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRD)
of both stars. The donor star (top panel) evolves off the main
sequence and $\sim8400$\,years later, when the donor's effective
temperature reaches about $T_\mathrm{eff}\simeq 10^4$\,K, mass transfer starts. This
results in a stable case B RLOF. We refer to \cite{gotberg:17, laplace:21, blagorodnova:21}
and references therein for a detailed description of the evolution of
massive donor stars in binaries. Although our models here are
more massive than those presented there, the qualitative behavior is similar.

At the onset of RLOF, the accretor star (bottom panel) is still on the
main sequence with $T_\mathrm{eff}\simeq10^{4.5}$\,K. Because of the
accretion of matter it quickly becomes over-luminous
($L\simeq10^{5.4}\,L_\odot$), and its radius increases dramatically
from $\sim7.5\,R_\odot$ to $\sim35\,R_\odot$. Once the accretor
reaches critical rotation (roughly at the lowest $T_\mathrm{eff}$ in
the bottom panel of \Figref{fig:HRD_both}), the star begins
contracting and its $T_\mathrm{eff}$ increases. At
$T_\mathrm{eff}\simeq 4.{43}$\,K the material transferred from the
companion star becomes progressively more He-rich, causing a
``v-shaped'' feature in the evolutionary track. This indicates that
the outer layers of the donor core are uncovered by mass transfer,
after the convective core recession in mass during the main
sequence. On top of modifying the morphology of the evolutionary
track, this late mass transfer puts material at high mean molecular
weight $\mu$ on top of the primordial envelope of the accretor. This
also starts vigorous thermohaline mixing in the accreting star, which,
together with rotational mixing, progressively dilutes the surface He
mass fraction and causes noisy features on the HR diagram
\citep[e.g.,][]{cantiello:07}. We discuss in more detail the mixing
processes inside the accretor in \Secref{sec:mixing}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MT}
  \caption{Mass transfer rates as a function of time during RLOF. The top (bottom) panel
    shows the donor (accretor) star. The cyan solid lines show the
    mass transfer rate between the two stars. The dashed blue lines
    show the actual change in the mass of the stars (due to the
    combination of wind, and accretion efficiency). The thin red
    lines show the wind mass loss rates. During RLOF the accretor
    reaches critical rotation, which leads to oscillations in the
    rotationally-enhahnced wind mass loss.}
  \label{fig:MT}
\end{figure}



\Figref{fig:MT} shows the rate of mass loss/accretion in both stars
during the RLOF phase. The top panel focuses on the donor star
which loses mass to RLOF (cyan line) and wind mass loss (thin red
line). The combined effect of these is shown in the dashed blue line.
The bottom panel shows instead the accreting star, which grows in mass
because of the mass transfer. The entire duration of this case B stable RLOF
is about $10^4$\,years, and the mass transfer rates reaches very high
values above $10^{-2.5}\,M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$.

The total amount of mass lost by the donor is
$\sim$$10.6\,M_\odot$, of which only
$\sim$$3.4\,M_\odot$ are successfully accreted by the
accretor. Accounting also for the wind mass loss, after RLOF the donor
star is a He star with
$\sim$$9.4\,M_\odot$, and the accretor is a H-rich star of
$\sim$$20.1\,M_\odot$. Presently available mass estimates for the
presently single \zoph\ are highly uncertain, but most include
$20\,M_\odot$. \todo{improve}

At the end of RLOF, the donor star briefly expands again
($T_\mathrm{eff}\simeq10^{4.1}$\,K, $L\simeq10^{5.5}\,L_\odot$). This
is due to the partial recombination of the He rich material now at the
surface, which causes a transient surface convection layer. We find
this to be the culprit of difficulties in modeling massive binaries
transferring mass in older \texttt{MESA} releases, because although
only a very small amount of mass is involved, this would lead to large
radial expansion much beyond the donor's Roche lobe, and cause
numerical problems.

    and the contribution from processes unrelated to rotation (think
    blue line). These include convection (shown in red), overshooting
    (visible above the convective core), thermohaline mixing (pink)
    and semiconvection (in purple).}
  \label{fig:D_mix}
\end{figure*}


After RLOF, the donor star is a 12.6$\,M_\odot$ core with surface He
mass fraction of $\sim$0.8, and quickly contracts. Such a star would
likely appear as a Wolf-Rayet \todo{Ylva: want to comment on
  appearance with companion star next to it?}.

\todo{fix this, and maybe goes into methods}
We keep evolving the
binary until core-He exhaustion of the donor \todo{defined how?}. The
evolutionary track of the top panel stops at this point.  We then take
the accretor, which has now a mass of $20.2\,M_\odot$ and an orbital
velocity of $\sim 52\kms$ (corresponding to a period of $\sim\,130$
days) and continue it evolution as a single star
with the same setup until its terminal age main sequence (shown in the
bottom panel).

The orbital velocity would likely decrease a bit further due to
wind-driven widening of the binary \todo{estimate and ref}, therefore
one can expect this system to produce a runaway star of velocity
comparable to \zoph\ if the stripped donor can successfully explode
\ref{schneider:20, laplace:21, vartanyan:21}.

    up the accretor at critical rotation. By the time the donor
    detaches from the RLOF the accretor is still spinning at
    $\sim$$400\,\kms$. At this point (beginning of the dot-dashed line), we continue the evolution as a single star, and the accretor quickly spins down. Note however that we use a wind mass-loss rate from \cite{vink:01}, which is observed to be
    $\sim$2 orders of magnitude too high.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have demonstrated that self-consistent one-dimensional calculations
of coupled stellar models with masses $\gtrsim 20\,M_\odot$ are
possible with the \texttt{MESA} software instrument. As a first
application, we focused on finding a model for \zoph, assuming its
runaway nature is explained by the binary SN scenario.

We found that it is likely possible to explain its surface composition
without assuming that the surface excess of He and N comes from within
the star. Instead, this material comes from the receeding core of the
donor star. Therefore, the present day abundances constrain the
accretion efficiency and mixing in the accretor.

\zoph\ should therefore \emph{not} be used to test models of
rotational mixing in single star evolution, nor its more extreme
version of chemically homogeneous evolution.

\section{\texttt{MESA} setup}
\label{sec:software}

\todo{MLT--?}

\todo{possibly move to methods}
We use \code{MESA} version 15140 to compute our models.  The
\code{MESA} equation of state (EOS) is a blend of the OPAL \citet{Rogers2002}, SCVH
\citet{Saumon1995}, PTEH \citet{Pols1995}, HELM \citet{Timmes2000},
and PC \citet{Potekhin2010} EOSes. \todo{check if updated EOS?}

Radiative opacities are primarily from OPAL \citep{Iglesias1993,
  Iglesias1996}, with low-temperature data from \citet{Ferguson2005}
and the high-temperature, Compton-scattering dominated regime by
\citet{Buchler1976}. Electron conduction opacities are from
\citet{Cassisi2007}.

Nuclear reaction rates are a combination of rates from NACRE
\citep{Angulo1999}, JINA REACLIB \citep{Cyburt2010}, plus additional
tabulated weak reaction rates \citet{Fuller1985, Oda1994,
  Langanke2000}. Screening is included via the prescription of
\citet{Chugunov2007}.  Thermal neutrino loss rates are from
\citet{Itoh1996}. We use a
22-isotope nuclear network (\texttt{approx\_21\_plus\_cr56}).

We treat convection using the Ledoux criterion, and include
thermohaline mixing and semiconvection, both with an efficiency factor
of 1. We assume $\alpha_\mathrm{MLT}=1.5$ and use \todo{fix}
\cite{brott:11} overshooting for the convective core
burning. \todo{fix} Moreover, we employ the MLT++ artificial
enhancement of the convective flux \citep[e.g.,][]{paxton:15}. Stellar
winds are included using the algorithms from \cite{vink:01} with an
efficiency factor of
1.% and \cite{nugis:00} when the surface en abundance
% is below 0.4 and $T_\mathrm{eff}>10^{4.7}\,\mathrm{K}$. We use a
% hyperbolic tangent interpolation between the two for
% hydrogen-deficient surfaces with
% $10^{4.5}\,\mathrm{K}\leq T_\mathrm{eff}\leq10^{4.7}\,\mathrm{K}$. In
% both cases, we use an efficiency factor of 1, and our post-merger models never
% become cool enough to use a cool wind algorithm \citep[e.g.,][]{renzo:17}.
